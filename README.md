# MediAI: Virtual Doctor Chatbot 🤖💊

MediAI is a web-based AI chatbot designed to assist users with preliminary medical diagnosis based on symptoms and general medical queries. It uses machine learning models like Extra Trees Classifier for disease prediction and Sentence-BERT for natural language question-answering. The bot can also recommend nearby specialists using geolocation APIs.
